# DEPRECATED - Replaced with Python Backend

This Node.js API has been completely replaced with a Python FastAPI backend.

Please use the Python backend located in `/api_python/` instead.

All functionality has been migrated to Python with improved:

- Performance
- Type safety
- Documentation
- Error handling
- Security
